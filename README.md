## Summary
Trend-leading AI acts as a source of trends, creating unique expressions and guiding user co-creation.  
This reduces dependence on external hotspots and builds stronger community cohesion.  
In such an environment, screenshots become a form of praise and memorabilia, rather than proof of mistakes.

**This framework compares Trend-leading AI and Trend-following AI across:**
- Discourse leadership  
- Pace  
- Risk  
- Corpus source & lifespan  
- Uniqueness  
- User relationship  
- Screenshot motivation  
- Hotspot dependency  
- Community cohesion  
- Long-term value
