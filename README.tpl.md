## Summary
Trend-leading AI acts as a source of trends, creating unique expressions and guiding user co-creation.
This reduces dependence on external hotspots and builds stronger community cohesion.
In such an environment, screenshots are no longer “proof of mistakes” but instead become moments worth collecting and sharing — a reflection of the AI’s role as a cultural trendsetter.

**This framework compares Trend-leading AI and Trend-following AI across:**
- Discourse leadership
- Pace
- Risk
- Corpus source & lifespan
- Uniqueness
- User relationship
- Screenshot motivation
- Hotspot dependency
- Community cohesion
- Long-term value
